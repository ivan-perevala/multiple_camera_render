You can find all the essential functionality in Topbar > Render section. There you would find a bunch of operators for rendering and simulating sequential rendering as well as options for running them.

In right corner of 3D view header you can find "Select Camera" switch. This would help selecting cameras.

If you have any issues, please, use GitHub issue tracker to submit the issue. It would be nice if you would attach some related log files to tracker.

Thank you for reading and using our software!
