## About

Addon for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for sequential rendering from multiple cameras.

The addon was created for prototyping photogrammetric, photometric or volumetric captures of multiple-camera rigs.

It enables quick simulation of not only the location of the cameras, but also the selection of the desired lens, reproduction of inaccuracies from the real world (lens distortion, depth of field, chromatic aberration, etc.). That is, you can set up a scene and create a synthetic dataset for testing in your photogrammetry software.

Obviously, the addon can be used not only for these purposes, but also with any scenes where you need to render from several different cameras - this is also a good use case for it. 

An example of use can be the creation of render proxy [impostors](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Tools/RenderToTextureTools/3/index.html) for Unity or Unreal.

## How To Use the Addon

Download the latest addon version from the [releases page](https://github.com/BlenderHQ/multiple_camera_render/releases/latest) and install it according to the [Blender manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#installing-add-ons).

---

This means that you have a multi-camera scene, for example imported from photogrammetry software or manually created. After installing the addon, new options will appear in the render menu:

* `Use Multiple Camera Render` - Whether to use render from multiple cameras. If the flag is not active, rendering will take place in the usual way.
* `Use in Viewport` - When changing the current frame, changes will be displayed in the viewport. This does not affect the render file path, it will only show the order in which the cameras will be changed during rendering.
