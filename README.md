# Multiple Camera Render

Extension for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for sequential rendering from multiple cameras.

![Camera Order Example](./release/images/camera_order.gif)

There are many possible uses for this addon - it all depends on your imagination. In general, the idea is that in a scene with multiple cameras, once rendering from one camera is finished, rendering from the next one begins. This applies to both image and animation rendering. Since rendering is usually a lengthy process, the addon also includes the option to preview its functionality in advance.
