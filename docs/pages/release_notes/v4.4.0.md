# Multiple Camera Render 4.4.0 Release Notes

This release introduces new workflow possibilities outside of sequential rendering as well. Now it is more general-purpose.

* **Introduced select camera feature.**
  
  It allows to make selected camera scene's active.

  Current implementation works a little bit different: it would only set camera active if its not already set and,
  most importantly, only if active object have changed (basically, only if you select an another camera).

* **Introduced per camera feature.**

  This feature allows to set different settings related to render for each camera in the scene separately.

  On a screenshot above you can see flags that can be captured per camera. At the moment they are unchanged from the Individual Camera Properties addon, so existing users should not be confused, but in the future they may be extended to support more features.

* **More end-to-end tests**

  Both new features are covered by tests, so they should be ready for production use. Added mixin tests, which are checking if all existing functionality works well together.


## Credits and Notes

Both new features are already implemented in other addons, but they both are incompatible with Multiple Camera Render. As you can see from [issue report](https://github.com/ivan-perevala/multiple_camera_render/issues/3), almost 14 hours of render time was ruined, which is inappropriate.

However, was decided to implement similar features in compatible way as far as it opens more workflow possibilities. No code was "stolen", Multiple Camera Render have different implementation of both features:

* [Auto Active Camera Switcher](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/auto-active-camera-switcher/)
* [Individual Camera Properties](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/individual-camera-properties/)
