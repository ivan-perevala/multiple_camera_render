 This feature allows to set different settings related to render for each camera in the scene separately.

 The idea of it was taken from the [Individual Camera Properties](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/individual-camera-properties/) addon, but it is designed to work seamlessly with **Multiple Camera Render** functionality. Please note that this is separate addon, so they are not supposed to be used together - this may lead to unexpected results.

 On a screenshot above you can see flags that can be captured per camera. At the moment they are unchanged from the Individual Camera Properties addon, so existing users should not be confused, but in the future they may be extended to support more features.

 Also there is a status indicator in bottom right corner of status bar that shows whether per camera feature is enabled or not:

 The whole feature is also covered by **end-to-end tests**, so it should be stable and ready for production use.
