# Multiple Camera Render 4.2.1 Release Notes

* **Updated libraries** due to [requirements of Blender Extensions Platform](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/extensions/python_wheels.html#requirements):
  - [bhqmain](https://pypi.org/project/bhqmain/) - Initialization framework for Blender extensions.
  - [bhqrprt](https://pypi.org/project/bhqrprt/) - Python package designed to streamline the process of logging for Blender extension development.
  - [bhqui](https://pypi.org/project/bhqui/) - UI components for Blender extensions.

    All of them are available on PyPI now, and are license-compatible with the Blender Extensions Platform requirements.

* Added **spell check automation** workflow using ``codespell``. Fixed spells.

* **Updated tests**. For CI/CD platforms, added `--background-only` option. This would skip all tests which are not in background mode. Also test dataset was updated to Cycles, as far as it does not require display to be run on.

* Added **GitHub actions** to automate tests as much as possible. Basically, tests which do not require UI would be run for each new commit.
