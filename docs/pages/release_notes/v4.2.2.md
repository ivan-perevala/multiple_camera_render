# Multiple Camera Render 4.2.2 Release Notes

* Created [documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://multiple-camera-render.readthedocs.io/latest/) platform. It should provide more clear information about how to use the addon, how to submit issues and about libraries used by this project.

* Minor fixes for scene properties:
    - None of them are supposed to be animated as far as they are evaluated only at initialization of multiple camera rendering, so that fixed now.
    - Added missing description for ``Cameras Usage`` property.
