# Multiple Camera Render 4.2.2 Release Notes (Upcoming)

* Created [documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://mcr.readthedocs.io/latest/) platform. It should provide more clear information about how to use the addon, how to submit issues and about libraries used by this project. Project metadata also has been updated to display documentation as a website.

* Minor fixes for scene properties:
    - None of them are supposed to be animated as far as they are evaluated only at initialization of multiple camera rendering, so that fixed now.
    - Added missing description for ``Cameras Usage`` property.
