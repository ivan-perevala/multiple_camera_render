# Multiple Camera Render 4.3.2 Release Notes

* Removed conflict tracking functionality. More information can be found on [user manual page](https://mcr.readthedocs.io/latest/pages/conflicts.html).

* In order to prevent such situations, changed addon internal logic. Now actual camera change is executed right before launching render, not after previous was completed.

* Moved options to separate popup. Now they can be changed without reopening `Render` menu over and over again:
  ![UI v4.3.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-perevala/multiple_camera_render/refs/heads/main/.github/images/ui_v432.webp)

* Fixed error when sequential rendering or preview was called while previous execution was not finished yet.

* Fixed missing icons and errors after re-enabling addon.
