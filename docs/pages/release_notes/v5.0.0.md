# Multiple Camera Render 5.0.0 Release Notes

* **Introduced markers workflow**
   Standard Blender camera markers is a nice tool for sequential camera rendering but they have some limitations. However, they still should be considered in a first place over an addon as native functionality. So now we introducing a new timeline marker operator "Markers From Cameras". It allows to automatically create markers from all or selected cameras, using different sorting algorithms.

* **Breaking Changes**
    * Updated scene properties:
        * "Camera Usage" - would not be read from older saved files.
        * "Direction" - Renamed to "Order". Removed "Counter" option, added "Original" - this would sort cameras as they are stored in `*blend` file (and seen in outliner). Property would not be read from older saved files.
        * "Reverse" - a new property instead of "Counter"
