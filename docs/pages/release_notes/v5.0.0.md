# Multiple Camera Render 5.0.0 Release Notes

* **Introduced markers workflow**

    Introducing a new workflow possibilities with [standard Blender markers](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/markers.html):

   * **Markers from Cameras** operator. Allows to create timeline markers using the same arrangement options as for sequential render. This feature mostly designed to improve standard Blender workflow, so you don't need to manually create marker for each camera. 
   
   * **Frame Usage Option**. May be used to render **from multiple cameras at multiple frames** using markers. It does not applies to animation rendering, but there is a possibility to render sequences on all frame markers or just selected ones.
  
  * **Compatibility**.
    
    Previous versions of Multiple Camera Render addon was not working well with markers. For example, if you had markers with binded cameras, it would interrupt animation rendering from multiple cameras, introducing unexpected results (the same cameras from markers would be used as standard functionality does) - this also applies to per-camera feature, it just would not work this way.

    Obviously, if user want to use Multiple Camera Render operators, it should be done and should not be interrupted.

    Now Multiple Camera Render would temporarily disable markers for execution time and restore them after. This way everything would work as expected. 

* **Per-Camera Feature Updates**
  
    * Added option "Use Per Camera" to render properties contextual menu.

        This would make life easier as far as no need to search for option in long list.  

    * **More Available Options**.

        Initially per-camera feature was introduced with the same options as "Individual Camera Properties" addon, but now there is more options available:

          * **Frame Start**, **Frame End** - probably, the most important.
          * TODO: Fill all options  

* **Breaking Changes**
    * Updated scene properties:
        * "Camera Usage" - would not be read from older saved files.
        * "Direction" - Renamed to "Order". Removed "Counter" option, added "Original" - this would sort cameras as they are stored in `*blend` file (and seen in outliner). Property would not be read from older saved files.
        * "Reverse" - a new property instead of "Counter"
