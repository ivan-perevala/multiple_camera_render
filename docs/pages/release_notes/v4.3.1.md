# Multiple Camera Render 4.3.1 Release Notes

* Changed conflict handling due to report on Blender Extensions platform. For now Multiple Camera Render only logs conflicts without removing them from Blender event handlers. This may cause incorrect behavior when working in pair with other addons, so it is highly recommended not to ignore warnings which remains in the UI.
