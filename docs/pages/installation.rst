Installation
============

Extension is available on Blender Extension platform:

`Multiple Camera Render <https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/multiple-camera-render/>`_

Please, read the documentation about how to install Blender extensions:

`Blender Manual <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/extensions.html#installing-extensions>`_

For those who wants to install the extension manually, you can download the latest release from the GitHub repository:

`Multiple Camera Render Releases <https://github.com/ivan-perevala/multiple_camera_render/releases>`_

You can not install the extension by downloading repository directly, because it does not contains
required libraries.
